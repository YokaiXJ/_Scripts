# Collection of multiple Scripts

### Summary
    This is a little collection of multiple scripts I wrote.
    The files are sorted by language and the usage.
    Most of the files are useless for other peoples, but maybe 
    they will help them to solve their problems or give some 
    kind of input ot their individual problems.
